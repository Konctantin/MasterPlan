# MasterPlan
Master Plan modifies the Garrison Missions UI, making it easier to figure out what you want to do. It can both suggest and complete parties to maximize mission rewards; see below for details.

Bug reports and feature suggestions should be submitted using the [ticket tracker](http://wow.curseforge.com/addons/master-plan/tickets/?per-page=40). For some frequently-posted comments, see [the FAQ page](https://www.townlong-yak.com/master-plan/faq.html).

### Some highlights:

* The available missions list fits more missions on screen, shows you the mission's threats, and some suggested groups and their expected results, allowing you to quickly select the party for the mission. Right-clicking on individual group suggestions allows you to set up tentative parties for multiple missions, which can then be sent with a single button click.
* Missions of Interest tab shows a list of high-reward missions, as well as your current best parties (ignoring follower item levels and levels). You can use this information to figure out which followers are safe to deactivate, as well as which followers you should re-activate.
* Followers tab offers quick access to gear upgrades and trait-rerolling items. Once Missions of Interest have been computed, it will also tell you which traits and abilities are safe to replace/retrain (and would not negatively impact any Missions of Interest groups).
   * You can search for intersections of multiple queries by concatenating queries with a semicolon (e.g. Wild Aggression;Group Damage), invert the result of a query by prefixing it with an exclamation mark (e.g. !Wild Aggression), and prefix queries with a plus to explore some hypothetical possibilities. Additionally, you can search for "Upgradable gear", "Redundant", and "Duplicate counters".
* The Garrison Report gains trackers for your Garrison Cache and Inn recruitment, as well as a tab summarizing garrison cooldowns for your other characters.
